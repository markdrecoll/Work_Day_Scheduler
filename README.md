# Work Day Scheduler

This is a day planner program. A user can input items and they will be saved to their local computer so that when the user reloads the page the information is not lost. The program gathers real time data to determine what hour of the day it is. The current hour is highlighted a certain color, and future and past hours are colored differently.
